## Overview

This automatic brake control system is designed for small vehicles or robots. The system uses an STM32F4 microcontroller, Arduino, a L298N Motor Driver, LiDAR sensors, and a custom mobile application. The STM32F4 acts as the main processing unit of the system, gathering data from the LiDAR sensors and sending control signals to the Arduino to manage the braking operation.

## Installation

The installation steps will be something like:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
4. Setup the STM32F4 environment.
5. Connect the LiDAR sensor and L298N to the system according to the provided schematic.

## Usage

Describe how to run the system after installation.
